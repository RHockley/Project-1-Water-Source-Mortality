# Project-1-Water-Source-Mortality
Files for project 1 dealing with water availability and mortality

This repository was created for the use of Robbie, Danny, and Vanessa to collaborate in creating a study of deaths related to diarrohea and a country's wealth between the years 2015-2019. This is project 1 for the Data Analytics bootcamp created by Trilogy Education through the University of Western Australia.

Data was downloaded in csv format from https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=G8 and https://ourworldindata.org/diarrheal-diseases for country GDP per capita and diarrheal deaths respectively. There was some data cleaning needed in excel to remove unnecessary columns and find the mean of the country's GDP per capita over the target years.
